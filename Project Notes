## 1. 📷 ZEUS  
**2008 – Present**  
*Software for automated camera monitoring and post-processing.*

**What it is**  
ZEUS is a software platform designed to monitor environments using cameras automatically. It captures video feeds and provides tools for post-processing the visual information (like measuring changes or extracting data).

**Why it matters**  
It represents the foundational layer of robotics: perception. Before a robot can act, it needs to see and understand its environment. ZEUS is about turning raw video into usable data.

**Key takeaway**  
Automated visual monitoring is the first step toward intelligent systems. If you can teach a camera to measure changes, you can later teach a robot to react to them.

## 2. 🌊 ZEUS - Fluem  
**2008 – Present**  
*Real-time water quality control using hyperspectral cameras.*

**What it is**  
An extension of the ZEUS project, this prototype uses advanced hyperspectral imaging (cameras that see beyond visible light) to analyze the quality of water in reservoirs in real time.

**Why it matters**  
This takes simple monitoring and adds a layer of scientific analysis. It shows how robotics tools (cameras, real-time processing) can solve environmental engineering problems.

**Key takeaway**  
Robotics isn't just about building humanoid machines. It's about using sensors and automation to understand the physical world—in this case, keeping water supplies safe.

## 3. 🏗️ SRECMOCOS Project  
**2011 – Present**  
*Small scale REal-time Caisson MOnitoring and COntrol System.*

**What it is**  
A project focused on monitoring floating structures (like caissons used in ports). It combines control theory, wireless sensors, and real-time simulation to track the behavior of these structures.

**Why it matters**  
This is cyber-physical systems applied to civil engineering. It bridges the gap between physical infrastructure and digital twins, allowing engineers to simulate and monitor structural health simultaneously.

**Key takeaway**  
Real-time monitoring + simulation = predictive maintenance. You can spot problems before they become disasters by having a digital model that runs in parallel with the real object.

## 4. 🧩 JdeRobot  
**Jan 2003 – Present**  
*A development suite for robotics, home automation, and computer vision.*

**What it is**  
JdeRobot is a framework (written in C++) that helps programmers build intelligent software for robots. It uses a component-based architecture where different behaviors (like "follow a line" or "avoid obstacles") are loaded as plugins.

**Why it matters**  
It teaches you how to structure robot software. Instead of writing one massive program, you break the robot's brain into smaller, concurrent pieces (schemas) that run simultaneously.

**Key takeaway**  
Robotic software is concurrent. A robot must process vision, plan paths, and control motors all at once. JdeRobot provides a blueprint for managing that complexity.

## 5. 🧠 Local Memory of a mobile robot based on depth sensors  
**Jun 2011 – Jun 2012**  
*Final Project: Using Kinect to help a robot remember its surroundings and follow a person.*

**What it is**  
A university final project where the student integrated a Kinect depth sensor onto a mobile robot. The robot builds a "local memory" of its environment using self-localization techniques and then uses that memory to navigate while following a person.

**Why it matters**  
This is a classic robotics pipeline: Sense (Kinect) → Localize (where am I?) → Map (what's around me?) → Act (follow the person). It’s a hands-on implementation of SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) basics.

**Key takeaway**  
Depth sensors like Kinect are game-changers for robotics. They give robots 3D understanding, enabling them to build memories of spaces and interact dynamically with moving targets (people).

## 6. 🚁 Proyecto ERLE  
**Jun 2012 – Present**  
*Creating a tiny, affordable flying robot—the "Arduino of robotics."*

**What it is**  
A project to build a palm-sized quadcopter (about 10cm in diameter) that costs around €150. It runs Ubuntu, uses standard tech like WiFi and Bluetooth, and is programmable via ROS. It's designed to be accessible to everyone, from students to hobbyists.

**Why it matters**  
This project democratizes robotics. By making a cheap, small, Linux-powered drone, it lowers the barrier to entry. You don't need a million-dollar lab to start programming flying robots.

**Key takeaway**  
Small, affordable, and open-source hardware can create a massive community. The "Arduino of robotics" isn't about being the most powerful; it's about being the most accessible.

## 7. 🕷️ Erle-Spider, the Linux legged drone  
**Jun 2015 – Present**  
*A hexapod robot (spider) with 18 motors, running ROS on Linux.*

**What it is**  
A six-legged walking robot (hexapod) powered by the Erle-Brain 2 (a Linux brain for robots). It has 18 degrees of freedom (3 per leg) and uses a distributed software architecture based on ROS.

**Why it matters**  
Wheels are easy; legs are hard. This project tackles the complexity of legged locomotion. It moves from the simplicity of a flying drone (ERLE) to a ground robot that must manage balance and gait coordination.

**Key takeaway**  
Legged robots require sophisticated control software. ROS helps manage the complexity by distributing the workload across different nodes (e.g., one node for each leg's gait).

## 8. 👁️ Visual localization for Augmented Reality  
**Apr 2014 – Present**  
*Master thesis: Estimating a camera's position in real-time using only its images.*

**What it is**  
A Master's thesis focused on visual self-localization—figuring out where a camera is and how it's oriented just by looking at the images it captures. It implements algorithms from simple DLT (Direct Linear Transform) to advanced methods like monoSLAM and PTAM. It was validated on a webcam and an Android device, even integrating it with an AR game.

**Why it matters**  
This is the core technology behind Google Tango, ARKit, and ARCore. Understanding how a camera tracks its position in space is fundamental to both Augmented Reality and robot navigation (Visual Odometry).

**Key takeaway**  
Your phone can locate itself in 3D space without GPS, using only its camera. The math behind this (monoSLAM, PTAM) is the same math that helps robots explore unknown environments.

## 9. 🔌 H-ROS: Hardware Robot Operating System  
**Jan 2016 – Present**  
*Creating plug-and-play hardware components for robots.*

**What it is**  
H-ROS is an infrastructure (hardware + software) that aims to make robot components "smart" and interoperable. Imagine buying a motor, a camera, or a gripper from different manufacturers, plugging them together, and having them automatically recognize each other and work as one robot. H-ROS defines four part types: Cognition (brain), Communication (network), Sensing (perception), and Actuation (movement).

**Why it matters**  
Currently, building a robot is like building a computer in the 1980s—you have to wire everything manually and write custom drivers. H-ROS aims to make it like USB: plug in a component, and it just works.

**Key takeaway**  
The future of robotics is horizontal integration. Standardized, interoperable hardware components will allow anyone to assemble a robot as easily as building with LEGO bricks, dramatically speeding up innovation and repair.
